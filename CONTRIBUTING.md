## Issues and PRs

If you have suggestions for how Stale could be improved, or want to report a bug, open an issue! We'd love all and any contributions. If you have questions, too, we'd love to hear them.

We'd also love PRs. If you're thinking of a large PR, we advise opening up an issue first to talk about it, though! Look at the links below if you're not sure how to open a PR.

## Just starting out? Looking for how to help?

Use [this search][good-first-issue-search] to find Probot apps that have issues marked with the `good-first-issue` label.

## Apps

We have one app enabled on this repo:

- [Stale](https://probot.github.io/apps/stale/): We use Stale (the app created in this repo) to ensure that conversations here remain relevant. This is for us, the maintainers, so that we don't feel like we've got hundreds of issues to deal with; if you still have an issue, please let us know! We don't want to close issues that are painful for you. Stale just helps us have a bit more breathing space by making sure issues don't pile up forever.

If you're concerned about our apps or feel that they are insensitive in some way, please let us know.
